# backgammon
The backgammon game in Python

# Goals:
- Represent game state and legal moves efficiently in numpy
	- avoid mutation when possible
	- FP
- Pretty print game state to console
- Run interactive loop to allow two players to play eachother

# Dev Env
Dependencies:
- Python v3.10

I use `pyenv` to manage Python version and `venv` to manage an isolated Python virtual environment. See tutorial [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/manage-multiple-python-versions-and-virtual-environments-venv-pyenv-pyvenv-a29fb00c296f/). I also use VSCode to automagically activate/use the venv.
